# sunny_21_bd
A gift for Sunny, the coooooolest girl and my soulmate, at her 21st birthday.

A small visual crypto program based on our fav. artist [SARAH BAHBAH](https://sarah-bahbah.myshopify.com/). The visual crypto algorithm is first proposed by [Moni Naor and Adi Shamir](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0053419) in 2006.

>We extend it into a visual variant of the k out of n secret shazing problem, in which a dealer provides a transparency to each one of the n users; any k of them can see the image by stacking their trazasparencies, but any k - 1 of them gain no information about it. 


## Install & Requirements
1. Python >= 3.6
2. Pillow


## For Sunny who knows NOTHING about programming

Download Python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/)


Type the following in your termial and hit ENTER
```
pip3 install --upgrade Pillow
```


## To play with it
```
python3 show.py sunny.png ciphered.png
```

Only Sunny has the `sunny.png` key which decodes the `ciphered.png`. After verifying my math, I highly recommend everyone to refrain from trying to find the correct pixel combinations brutally :-).
