A gift for Sunny, the coooooolest girl and my soulmate, at her 21st birthday.

A small visual crypto program based on our fav. artist [SARAH BAHBAH](https://sarah-bahbah.myshopify.com/). The visual crypto algorithm is first proposed by [Moni Naor and Adi Shamir](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0053419) in 2006. 

## Install & Requirements
1. Python >= 3.6
2. Pillow

## For Sunny who knows NOTHING about programming

Download Python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/)


Type the following in your termial and hit ENTER
```
pip3 install --upgrade Pillow
```

## To play with it
```
python3 show.py sunny.png ciphered.png
```
where only Sunny has the encrypted `sunny.png` :-)
